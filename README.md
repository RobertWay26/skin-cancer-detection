# skin-cancer-detection

I built the model in Python using TensorFlow and constructed a deep learning architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers. The model comprises over 7.3 million trainable parameters and achieved a validation accuracy of 87%.

To enhance the model's performance, I processed and normalized a dataset of 2,637 skin lesion images. Real-time visualizations were generated using Matplotlib to monitor the model's training progress, prompting the implementation of early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques, which accelerated convergence and minimized overfitting.

This project showcases my skills in deep learning, data preprocessing, and model optimization to address real-world medical challenges.
